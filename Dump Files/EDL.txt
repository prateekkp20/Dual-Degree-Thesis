One of the most prominent applications of 2D Ewald summation lies in the simulation of Electrical Double Layers (EDLs). EDL is a morphological arrangement of charged atoms that forms at the interface between a charged surface and an adjacent electrolytic solution. This concept is foundational in colloid science, electrochemistry, and interfacial physics. The generally accepted model of EDL comprises of the Stern layer (or compact layer), where specifically adsorbed ions (and sometimes solvent molecules) are located immediately next to the charged surface, and the diffuse layer (or Gouy-Chapman layer), which extends into the bulk liquid with ion distributions governed by a balance of electrostatic forces and thermal motion.

Understanding electrostatic interactions in confined and interfacial systems is fundamental to numerous areas in physical chemistry, materials science, and biophysics. A key example is the **electrical double layer (EDL)**—a structured distribution of ions that forms at the interface between a charged surface and an electrolyte. This phenomenon governs a wide range of processes, from surface wetting and colloidal stability to ion transport and energy storage in electrochemical systems.

The EDL is commonly described through the Stern model, which divides the interfacial region into a compact layer of specifically adsorbed ions and a diffuse layer where ions are distributed under the competing influence of electrostatic forces and thermal motion. However, despite the conceptual clarity of this model, the molecular-scale behavior of the EDL is highly complex and sensitive to factors like ion size, valency, solvent structure, and surface geometry. Capturing these features accurately requires molecular simulations that treat long-range Coulomb interactions with high precision.

A major challenge arises when simulating systems with **slab geometries**—configurations that are periodic in two dimensions (parallel to the interface) and finite in the third (normal to the surface). Traditional approaches to computing electrostatic interactions, such as the 3D Ewald summation, assume full periodicity and are therefore ill-suited to such geometries. Applying 3D Ewald methods to slab systems leads to unphysical interactions between periodic images in the non-periodic direction, distorting the ion distributions and energetics central to EDL behavior.

This disconnect between simulation methods and physical geometry creates a compelling need for techniques that respect the inherent asymmetry of slab systems. **2D Ewald summation** emerges as a powerful framework to address this challenge. It offers a way to handle electrostatics in systems with planar periodicity without introducing artifacts from artificial periodicity in the normal direction.

Despite its relevance, the use of 2D Ewald summation remains relatively limited due to its mathematical complexity and computational demands. There is a strong motivation to further develop, validate, and apply this method in order to enable more accurate simulations of interfacial systems, especially those involving EDLs. A deeper, simulation-driven understanding of EDL structure and dynamics can contribute to progress in fields as diverse as electrochemical energy storage, nanofluidics, and biomolecular surface interactions.

In this context, the study of 2D Ewald summation is not only a theoretical interest but a necessary step toward bridging the gap between simulation accuracy and the physical realities of interfacial systems.
