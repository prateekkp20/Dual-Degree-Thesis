Electrical double layer (EDL) is a morphological arrangement of charged atoms that forms at the interface between a charged surface and an adjacent electrolytic solution. This concept is foundational in colloid science, electrochemistry, and interfacial physics. The generally accepted model of EDL comprises of the Stern layer (or compact layer), where specifically adsorbed ions (and sometimes solvent molecules) are located immediately next to the charged surface, and the diffuse layer (or Gouy-Chapman layer), which extends into the bulk liquid with ion distributions governed by a balance of electrostatic forces and thermal motion.
