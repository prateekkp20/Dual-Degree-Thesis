\section{Background}
Computer simulations have been an inseparable part of scientific research since the advent of computing machines. They serve as a valuable tool and a helping hand in understanding physical phenomena, ranging from developing modern vaccines to designing advanced aerospace systems and predicting complex climate patterns. The basis of this technique is to define a mathematical model and to perform a series of step-by-step procedures to obtain a numerical solution. By leveraging sophisticated algorithms and high-performance computing resources, simulations facilitate the investigation of intricate systems with remarkable precision and efficiency. Simulation results have become indispensable for informed decision-making, policy formulation, and technological innovation in many disciplines.

\section{Molecular Simulations}
We want to understand the principles of science of atoms and molecules, by which they interact with each other in various chemical phenomena. We want to understand the connection between forces, energies, and potential fields with the observed properties. For these, \ac{MD} simulations are an important technique that determines the motion of many-body macroscopic systems obeying classical mechanics. It is a valuable tool offering profound insights into molecular behaviour at the atomic scale, significantly reducing the need for costly and time-intensive laboratory experiments.

Molecular dynamics is the simulation of molecules obeying classical laws of physics or Newton’s equations of motion. Through this approach, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are computed over time, enabling the study of structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of matter. Molecular simulations provide a dynamic picture of systems that complements static experimental observations by accurately modelling interatomic forces and integrating the equations of motion.

To achieve meaningful and accurate molecular simulations, defining appropriate models and equations that describe the subject system is essential. These modelling equations typically incorporate long-range interactions, such as van der Waals forces and Coulombic interactions, which will be discussed in the subsequent section.

\section{Long Range Interactions}
The term long-range interactions in chemical physics refers to electrostatic and magnetostatic potential energies between ions that vary with the inverse power of the distance ($r$) between them, or as $r^{-d}$, where \textit{d} is the dimensionality of the system \cite{simulation_of_liq}. Because these interactions are common in physical systems, it is essential to model them correctly. However, they also represent one of the most serious difficulties in \ac{MD} simulations. In bulk systems, each ion effectively interacts with an infinite number of neighbors. Trying to compute these interactions directly leads to a sum over infinitely many contributions. This is not only computationally unmanageable but also mathematically problematic, since the total Coulomb energy in three dimensions is conditionally convergent, meaning its value depends on the order in which the contributions are added. As a result, naïvely truncating the interactions at some large distance can produce misleading or incorrect results.

\subsection{Periodic Boundary Conditions}
To tackle the fundamental challenge of simulating an infinite system with a manageable number of particles, simulations typically employ \aclu{PBC} (\acs{PBC}). In this approach, the simulation box is repeated throughout the space to mimic a bulk or infinite system, forming an infinite periodic structure. The motion of the atoms in the original box is replicated in all of its other periodic images. Particles that leave one side of the box re-enter from the opposite side. This approach eliminates edge effects without requiring explicit surface molecules.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Minimum Image Convention}
The \aclu{MIC} (\acs{MIC})\cite{minimumimage,hloucha1998fast} is a simple but powerful rule used under periodic boundary conditions. It states that each particle should only interact with the nearest periodic image of every other particle. In practice, for every pair of particles, we compute the distance considering the closest image among all the periodic copies. This avoids double-counting and ensures that no interaction is calculated more than once. MIC is especially efficient for short-range potentials, where interactions beyond a certain cut-off are negligible. 

\subsection{Significance}
Proper treatment of long-range interactions is essential, as they govern key structural and thermodynamic properties of liquids, ionic systems, and biomolecules. Periodic boundary conditions allow a finite system to mimic bulk behaviour by eliminating surface effects, while the minimum image convention ensures interactions are computed efficiently and without ambiguity. Together, these methods enable accurate and physically meaningful simulations of infinite systems using a tractable number of particles.

\section{Objective of the Thesis}
Extensive research has been done to reduce the computational expense of long-range interactions in molecular simulations. Though the computer hardware is seeing continuous advances, a critical need remains for more efficient and scalable techniques that can accurately model and simulate large physical systems. Since the computational effort required to compute long-range coulombic interactions scales quadratically with the number of ions, developing algorithms that significantly reduce these costs, particularly for systems that exhibit reduced periodicities, is essential. 

The conventional approach for modelling slab geometries introduces a dipole correction \cite{dipole-yeh-berkowitz} to the Coulomb interactions within a fully periodic framework and an optimal vacuum in the non-periodic direction to minimize residual errors. Alternatively, exact formulations of the Ewald summation have been developed for systems with two-dimensional periodicity \cite{kawata, PARRY1975433,de1979electrostatic, Heyes19771485}, accounting rigorously for the anisotropic boundary conditions inherent to slab configurations. These methods accurately capture long-range electrostatics without relying on artificial corrections; however, their computational cost typically exceeds $O(NlogN)$, rendering them impractical for large-scale simulations.

The primary objective of this thesis is to develop and implement an exact 2D Ewald summation algorithm that achieves the same computational complexity as the traditional 3D Ewald method, while offering improved efficiency and scalability. Additionally, this work focuses on writing high-performance, optimized code, emphasizing efficient memory access, vectorization, and cache-friendly data structures, and further optimizing the computational performance through parallelization using OpenMP. Through the development of novel algorithm tailored for 2D periodic systems, combined with low-level code optimizations facilitated by performance profiling using Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} VTune and parallelization using OpenMP, this thesis aims to provide a robust and practical framework for large-scale \acs{MD} simulations that can be useful to study some fundamental physical and chemical phenomena like thin films, surface science,  electrochemical interfaces and adsorption.
